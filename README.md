Search &amp; Replace Domain Names For Better WP Migrations

This program was originally written by http://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/. 
It's not terribly pretty, but it's portable and it solves an important problem that comes up whenever WordPress sites 
get renamed.

Usage
-----

1. clone it
2. name it something unique, that spiders won't guess
3. put it in your webroot folder
4. hit it with a browser and follow the prompts
5. delete the file in your webroot when complete

```
git clone https://github.com/jmandala/searchreplacedb2
cp searchreplacedb2 {YOUR_WEB_ROOT}/rename_db.php
```
